# Cafe: A Website Management System

## Introduction
Our website offers a seamless solution for ordering and payment at cafes. Users can select items, place orders online, and pay quickly, while cafe managers can easily track and manage orders,
along with generating effective reports.

## Purpose

My main goal is to entertain and please the players. I aim to provide a platform where users can enter a world of fun and excitement, whether they are playing alone or challenging friends. 
Additionally, I aim to inspire creativity and curiosity through my games, spark imagination and foster a love of gaming. Moreover, you can entertain yourself with fun and exciting games after stressful working
and studying hours. My desire is to aim for the best user experience and interface.
